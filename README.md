# cPanel Inode Usage Plugin

This plugin, created by [ChemiCloud.com](https://chemicloud.com) for their clients, provides real-time, detailed insights into inode usage for a cPanel account. It allows users to quickly assess their inode consumption across directories and subfolders, with inode counts updated dynamically on every page reload.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Unlike the default inode display in cPanel, this plugin updates inode usage in real-time with every page reload.
- **Detailed Directory Breakdown**: View inode counts for individual directories and subfolders, allowing users to identify areas consuming the most inodes.
- **Ownership Filtering**: Inodes are only counted for files and directories owned by the cPanel user, ensuring accurate usage reporting.
- **Large Directory Handling**: For accounts with more than 500,000 inodes, the counting process may take up to 1 minute, but provides a clear and complete overview of usage.
